# python_selenium_automation
Repo is based on python automation which has the selenium tests automated using pytest as well as behave.

Basic tests were written using the healthcare site which is a public site and safer to use.

The tests are configured using simple frameowrks collected from the different samples. They are replicated to work with both pytest and behave as standalone test runners.

Have resolved few challenges related to behave's page object pattern and made them available.
