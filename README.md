# python_selenium_automation
Repo is based on python automation which has the selenium tests automated using pytest and behave.

Written some basic tests using the healthcare site.

The tests are configured using simple frameowrks using pytest and behave as standalone test runners.

Have resolved few challenges related to behave's page object pattern and made them available.
